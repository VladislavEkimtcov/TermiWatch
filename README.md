I swear it all works, simulator just doesn't have the right data

# Changes:
* Changed layout slightly
* Added local sunset/sunrise
* Changed today's steps to today's walking distance (changes to km when further than 10,000m)
* Added distance to home (hardcoded because I can)
* wanted to add loudness meter, but it takes forever to update from healthkit so whatever, it'll just be dead code forever

# Installation
Same as original, except you're replacing *vladekimtcov* instead of *kuglee*
