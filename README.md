# Changes:
* Changed layout slightly
* Added local sunset/sunrise
* Changed today's steps to today's walking distance
* Added distance to home (hardcoded because I can) (changes to km when further than 10,000m, also accounts for indoor gps error)
* wanted to add loudness meter, but it takes forever to update from healthkit so whatever, it'll just be dead code forever

# Installation
Same as original, except you're replacing *vladekimtcov* instead of *kuglee*
